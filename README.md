# MLPerf Inference Visualization Template

If you have a [run](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GATEOverflow/inference_results_v4.1/main/run.sh) script, just run that in the root of your MLPerf inference_results repository.

```
INFERENCE_RESULTS_REPO_OWNER=${{ github.repository_owner }} bash run.sh
```

This will copy the template code including CSS/HTML overrides and the JS files from this template repository to the docs site of the inference results repository.

Hereâ€™s a more refined version of your documentation. It improves the structure and clarity, making it easier for someone to follow, understand, and maintain the project.

## Project Overview

This repository handles the results and comparison pages for machine learning inference benchmarks, dynamically generating content for both the main results and comparison pages. 

### Main Files

#### JavaScript Files

- **`common.js`**: Contains common JavaScript functions shared across the application.
  
- **`results_tablesorter.js`**: Manages the table sorting and population for the **Results** page, utilizing the **Tablesorter** plugin for sorting tables dynamically.
  
- **`compare_results.js`**: Contains the JavaScript logic for the **Compare** page, handling the specific functionality for the comparison of different inference results.
  
- **`topresults.js`**: Provides the JavaScript functionality for the **Top Results** page, dealing with the display and logic for top-performing models or results.
  
- **`chart_compare.js`**: Manages the rendering of charts specifically for the **Compare** page.
  
- **`chart_results.js`**: Handles chart generation and display for the **Results** page.
  
- **`chart_topresults.js`**: Responsible for rendering charts for the **Top Results** page.

- **`init_tablesorter.js`**: Initializes and configures the **Tablesorter** plugin for sorting tables on relevant pages.

#### Python Files

- **`process.py`**: Processes the `summary_results.json` file from the inference results repository and generates the **index.md** file for the **Compare** page.
  
- **`process_results.py`**: Takes the `summary_results.json` from the inference results repository and generates the **index.md** file for the **Results** page.

#### Page Generation Notes

- The **Compare** page is dynamically created using JavaScript. No Python code is involved in generating its HTML content.

#### Third Party Libraries Needed
- The code needs [TableSorter plugin](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter) for HTML table sorting and [CanvasJS](https://canvasjs.com/) for the chart rendering.

### Repository Workflow

1. **GitHub Actions Integration**:  
   This repository is designed to be cloned via GitHub Actions in the **inference_results** repositories. The cloning process is handled by a **GitHub Actions** workflow, as outlined in the [publish.yml](https://github.com/mlcommons/mlperf_inference_submissions/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish.yml) file.

2. **Dynamic Content Generation**:  
   - The **Compare** pages is rendered entirely via JavaScript.
   - **Results** and **Top Results** pages are generated dynamically through Python scripts `process.py` and `process_results.py` respectively, which process JSON data of the inference submissions and create the necessary markdown files for display.
